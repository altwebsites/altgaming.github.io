  ALT GAMING PLATFORM - HOW TO OPEN
========================================

To see the site WITH the dark theme and neon style:

1. Open this folder in File Explorer:
   C:\Users\frezz\altgamingplatform

2. Double-click:  index.html

3. It will open in your default browser. You should see:
   - Dark background (almost black)
   - Cyan and magenta "[ALT GAMING]" logo
   - "Play. Compete. Dominate." in big text

If you still see a WHITE page with plain black text:
- You may be opening a different file or an old copy.
- Make sure the folder path is exactly: C:\Users\frezz\altgamingplatform
- Try right-click index.html -> Open with -> Chrome (or Edge)

Secret: Triple-click the [ALT GAMING] logo to reveal the admin link.
